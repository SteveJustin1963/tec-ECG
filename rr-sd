# Input: R-R intervals data (rr_intervals)
# Output: Standard deviation of R-R intervals (hrv_sd)

# Step 1: Initialize variables
rr_count = len(rr_intervals)
rr_mean = 0
rr_diff_squared_sum = 0

# Step 2: Calculate mean of R-R intervals
for rr in rr_intervals:
    rr_mean += rr
rr_mean = rr_mean / rr_count

# Step 3: Calculate sum of squared differences from mean
for rr in rr_intervals:
    rr_diff_squared_sum += (rr - rr_mean) ** 2

# Step 4: Calculate standard deviation of R-R intervals
hrv_sd = (rr_diff_squared_sum / rr_count) ** 0.5

# Step 5: Output result
print("Standard deviation of R-R intervals:", hrv_sd)
