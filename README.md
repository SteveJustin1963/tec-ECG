# tec-ECG
TEC-1 apparatus for electrocardiography. also see eeg 



An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that records the electrical activity of the heart. It is a non-invasive and painless procedure that is used to detect heart problems and monitor the heart's health. A low-cost ECG project can be created using readily available and inexpensive components such as electrodes, op-amps, and a TEC1. The circuit would include a pre-amplifier to amplify the small electrical signals from the electrodes placed on the skin, a filter to remove unwanted noise, and a gain control to adjust the amplitude of the signal. The amplified and filtered ECG signal would then be sent to the TEC1 for further processing. The processed data can be displayed on an LCD or thermal printer or used for another stage.
